## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A browser with Web Bluetooth support (Chrome, Edge, Opera)
- HTTPS connection (required for Web Bluetooth API)
- KB1 hardware device (or enable Dev Mode for UI testing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PocketMidi/KB1-config.git
cd KB1-config
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure Dev Mode** (optional - for testing without hardware):

   Edit `src/composables/useDeviceState.ts` line 17:
   ```typescript
   const DEV_MODE = true;   // Dev mode ON - simulates connection with mock data
   const DEV_MODE = false;  // Production mode - requires KB1 hardware
   ```

4. Run development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL shown in terminal)

**Note:** For Web Bluetooth to work in development, you may need to:
- Use `localhost` (works over HTTP)
- Or set up HTTPS for your dev server
- Or use Chrome flags for testing: `chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment.

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Usage

### Connecting to Your KB1 Device

1. Click the **CONNECTED / DISCONNECTED** status in the top-right navigation bar
2. Select your KB1 device from the browser's Bluetooth pairing dialog
3. Once connected, the status will turn blue and display "CONNECTED"
4. The app will automatically load current settings from the device

**First Time Users**: A helpful overlay will explain the connection process on your first visit.

**Disconnected State**: When disconnected, all controls are shown but grayed out. Click any control to see a prompt to connect.

### SETTINGS Tab

The SETTINGS tab manages your device's global configuration:

**Scale Settings:**
- Choose from multiple scale types (Chromatic, Major, Minor, etc.)
- Set root note (C, C#, D, etc.)
- Toggle between Natural and Compact key mapping

**System Settings (Power Management):**
- **Light Sleep**: Timeout before entering light sleep (30-300 seconds, default: 90s)
- **Deep Sleep**: Timeout before entering deep sleep (120-1800s, must be >lightSleep+30s, default: 330s)
- **BLE Timeout**: Bluetooth keep-alive timeout (30-600s, must be >=deepSleep+30s, default: 600s)

**Actions:**
- **Load from Device**: Fetch current settings from KB1 hardware
- **Reset to Defaults**: Restore factory default settings
- **Save to Device**: Apply changes to RAM and automatically save to flash memory

**Preset Manager:**
- Save complete device configurations with custom names
- Quick-load saved presets
- Delete presets you no longer need
- Presets stored in browser localStorage (persists between sessions)

### CONTROLS Tab

The CONTROLS tab configures your KB1's physical controls:

**Lever 1 & Lever 2:**
- **CC Number**: Choose MIDI CC from Polyend map with descriptions
- **CC Range**: Set min/max values (0-127)
- **Step Size**: Quantize movement to steps
- **Function Mode**: Uni/Bi-directional, Momentary, Toggle
- **Value Mode**: Jump, Hook, Pickup, Latch

**Lever Push 1 & 2:**
- **CC Number**: Choose MIDI CC with descriptions  
- **CC Range**: Set min/max values
- **Function Mode**: Trigger, Momentary, Toggle
- **Interpolation**: Onset/offset timing and curves

**Touch Sensor:**
- **CC Number**: Choose MIDI CC
- **CC Range**: Set output range
- **Function Mode**: Trigger, Momentary
- **Threshold**: Adjust touch sensitivity (0-65535, default: 24000, lower = more sensitive)

**Actions:**
- **Load from Device**: Read current control settings
- **Reset to Defaults**: Restore factory control settings
- **Reset Changes**: Undo unsaved local changes
- **Save to Device**: Apply and persist all control settings

### SLIDERS Tab

The SLIDERS tab provides 12 customizable performance sliders for real-time MIDI CC control:

**Setup Mode** (Portrait or Desktop):
- **Color Selection**: Tap color swatch or drag vertical picker to choose from 12 colors
- **Bipolar/Unipolar Toggle**: Tap "BI" or "UNI" button to switch modes
- **Momentary/Latched Toggle**: Tap "M" or "L" button for spring-back or hold behavior
- **Link Sliders**: Drag across "link" icons between sliders to gang them (shared color, settings, values)
- **CC Assignment**: Each slider has its own CC number (51-62 by default)
- **Preset Management**: Save/load complete slider configurations via dropdown menu

**Live Mode** (Mobile - Landscape Fullscreen):
- **Enter**: Rotate device to landscape (iOS shows rotation animation)
- **Fullscreen**: Sliders fill the entire screen for performance
- **Control**: Drag sliders vertically to send MIDI CC in real-time
- **Swipe Exit**: Swipe horizontally >100px to exit
- **Rotate Exit**: Rotate back to portrait (iOS prompts with rotation animation)
- **Momentary**: Release touch on momentary sliders springs back to 0 with smooth animation

**Slider Features:**
- **Color Coded**: 12 rainbow colors for visual organization
- **Gang Control**: Linked sliders move together and share settings
- **Visual Feedback**: Colored fill shows current value with minimum visible height
- **Bipolar Mode**: Center line divider, both positive/negative fill from center
- **Unipolar Mode**: Bottom-up fill, 0-100% range

**Desktop Use:**
- All features work with mouse on desktop
- Setup and live modes available simultaneously
- Click and drag sliders for control

## Development Notes

### Development Mode (Testing Without Hardware)

The app includes a **DEV_MODE** flag for testing the UI without a physical KB1 device:

**To toggle:**
- Edit `src/composables/useDeviceState.ts` line 17:
  ```typescript
  const DEV_MODE = true;   // Dev mode ON - simulates connection with mock data
  const DEV_MODE = false;  // Production mode - requires KB1 hardware
  ```

**When DEV_MODE is enabled:**
- App auto-connects on load with simulated device "KB1 (Dev Mode)"
- All settings and controls are populated with default mock data
- Changes are logged to console but not sent to hardware
- Useful for UI development, layout testing, and demos

**Before production deployment:**
- Set `DEV_MODE = false` to require real hardware connection
- Test with actual KB1 device to verify BLE communication

### KB1 Protocol Implementation

The BLE communication layer is fully implemented with the KB1 firmware protocol:

**BLE Configuration** (`src/ble/bleClient.ts`):
- Service UUID: `f22b99e8-81ab-4e46-abff-79a74a1f2ff3`
- Direct characteristic access for all settings (Lever, LeverPush, Touch, Scale, System)
- MIDI characteristic: `eb58b31b-d963-4c7d-9a11-e8aabec2fe32`
- Keep-alive characteristic maintains connection (60s interval, 10min firmware grace period)

**Protocol Encoding** (`src/ble/kb1Protocol.ts`):
- Binary encoding/decoding for all settings (little-endian int32)
- Settings read/written directly to BLE characteristics
- Validation and default value creation
- Type-safe interfaces for all device settings

### Browser Compatibility

Web Bluetooth API is supported in:
- ✅ Chrome/Chromium 56+
- ✅ Edge 79+
- ✅ Opera 43+
- ❌ Firefox (requires flag)
- ❌ Safari (not supported)

For the best experience, use Chrome, Edge, or Opera.

### HTTPS Requirement

The Web Bluetooth API requires a secure context (HTTPS) except for `localhost`. When deploying:

- GitHub Pages provides HTTPS automatically
- Use a service with HTTPS support
- Or set up SSL certificates for your domain

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages (Automated)

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when you push to the `main` branch.

**To enable:**

1. Go to your repository Settings → Pages
2. Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
3. Push to the `main` branch
4. The site will be available at `https://pocketmidi.github.io/KB1-config/`

### Manual Deployment

Build the project and deploy the `dist/` folder to any static hosting service that supports HTTPS.
