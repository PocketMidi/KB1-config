# KB1 Config

KB1 Config is the official browser-based configuration and control application for the PocketMidi KB1 MIDI controller. This first release delivers a complete, wireless configuration environment with real-time performance control—configure keyboard modes, lever behavior, touch sensitivity, scales, power management, and control 12 performance sliders directly from your browser over Bluetooth Low Energy. No drivers, no apps to install.

## Quick Start Guide

**First Time Connection:**
1. Click **DISCONNECTED** in the top-right corner
2. Select "KB1" from your browser's Bluetooth pairing dialog
3. Once connected, settings automatically load from your device

**Using Performance Sliders (SLIDERS tab):**
- **Desktop/Portrait**: Tap color swatches, adjust settings, drag sliders vertically
- **Live Mode (Mobile)**: 
  - Rotate device to landscape → Sliders go fullscreen automatically
  - Control sliders with touch, swipe horizontally >100px to exit
  - Or rotate back to portrait to exit live mode
- **Linking Sliders**: Press and drag across the "link" icons between sliders to gang them (shared color, settings, and values move together)
- **Save Presets**: Use dropdown menu to save/load complete slider configurations

**Keyboard Modes (SETTINGS → KEYBOARD):**
- **Scale Mode**: Keys play quantized notes from selected scale
- **Chord Mode**: Each key plays a full chord
  - Toggle Chord/Strum button to switch between simultaneous or cascaded notes
  - Adjust "Smart Slider" for velocity spread (Chord) or strum speed (Strum)

**Saving Changes:**
- Modify any setting → Orange dot appears in footer showing unsaved changes
- Click **Save to Device** → Changes applied to RAM and automatically saved to flash memory
- Footer actions stick to bottom for quick access: **Load**, **Reset**, **Save**
- Use **Preset Manager** to save complete configurations with custom names (8 device slots + unlimited browser presets)

## Configuration Flexibility

The KB1 system offers **~10²⁷ total unique configurations** (approximately 1 octillion possible combinations). When focusing on the most commonly adjusted parameters—CC numbers, min/max values, function modes, and interpolation curves—there are still **~10¹⁰ to 10¹² practical combinations** (10-100 billion distinct configurations).

**Storage & Sharing:**
- 8 preset slots on device for storing favorite configurations
- Unlimited browser-based presets for sharing and experimenting

The system is extraordinarily flexible for any performance or production workflow.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A browser with Web Bluetooth support (Chrome, Edge, Opera)
- HTTPS connection (required for Web Bluetooth API)
- KB1 hardware device (or enable Dev Mode for UI testing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PocketMidi/KB1-config.git
cd KB1-config
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure Dev Mode** (optional - for testing without hardware):

   Edit `src/composables/useDeviceState.ts` line 17:
   ```typescript
   const DEV_MODE = true;   // Dev mode ON - simulates connection with mock data
   const DEV_MODE = false;  // Production mode - requires KB1 hardware
   ```

4. Run development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL shown in terminal)

**Note:** For Web Bluetooth to work in development, you may need to:
- Use `localhost` (works over HTTP)
- Or set up HTTPS for your dev server
- Or use Chrome flags for testing: `chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment.

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Usage

### Connecting to Your KB1 Device

1. Click the **CONNECTED / DISCONNECTED** status in the top-right navigation bar
2. Select your KB1 device from the browser's Bluetooth pairing dialog
3. Once connected, the status will turn blue and display "CONNECTED"
4. The app will automatically load current settings from the device

**First Time Users**: A helpful overlay will explain the connection process on your first visit.

**Disconnected State**: When disconnected, all controls are shown but grayed out. Click any control to see a prompt to connect.

### SETTINGS Tab

The SETTINGS tab manages your device's global configuration:

**Keyboard Settings:**

**Desktop Use:**
- All features work with mouse on desktop
- Setup and live modes available simultaneously
- Click and drag sliders for control

## Development Notes

### Development Mode (Testing Without Hardware)

The app includes a **DEV_MODE** flag for testing the UI without a physical KB1 device:

**To toggle:**
- Edit `src/composables/useDeviceState.ts` line 17:
  ```typescript
  const DEV_MODE = true;   // Dev mode ON - simulates connection with mock data
  const DEV_MODE = false;  // Production mode - requires KB1 hardware
  ```

**When DEV_MODE is enabled:**
- App auto-connects on load with simulated device "KB1 (Dev Mode)"
- All settings and controls are populated with default mock data
- Changes are logged to console but not sent to hardware
- Useful for UI development, layout testing, and demos

**Before production deployment:**
- Set `DEV_MODE = false` to require real hardware connection
- Test with actual KB1 device to verify BLE communication

### KB1 Protocol Implementation

The BLE communication layer is fully implemented with the KB1 firmware protocol:

**BLE Configuration** (`src/ble/bleClient.ts`):
- Service UUID: `f22b99e8-81ab-4e46-abff-79a74a1f2ff3`
- Direct characteristic access for all settings (Lever, LeverPush, Touch, Scale, System)
- MIDI characteristic: `eb58b31b-d963-4c7d-9a11-e8aabec2fe32`
- Keep-alive characteristic maintains connection (60s interval, 10min firmware grace period)

**Protocol Encoding** (`src/ble/kb1Protocol.ts`):
- Binary encoding/decoding for all settings (little-endian int32)
- Settings read/written directly to BLE characteristics
- Validation and default value creation
- Type-safe interfaces for all device settings

### Browser Compatibility

Web Bluetooth API is supported in:
- ✅ Chrome/Chromium 56+
- ✅ Edge 79+
- ✅ Opera 43+
- ❌ Firefox (requires flag)
- ❌ Safari (not supported)

For the best experience, use Chrome, Edge, or Opera.

### HTTPS Requirement

The Web Bluetooth API requires a secure context (HTTPS) except for `localhost`. When deploying:

- GitHub Pages provides HTTPS automatically
- Use a service with HTTPS support
- Or set up SSL certificates for your domain

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages (Automated)

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when you push to the `main` branch.

**To enable:**

1. Go to your repository Settings → Pages
2. Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
3. Push to the `main` branch
4. The site will be available at `https://pocketmidi.github.io/KB1-config/`

### Manual Deployment

Build the project and deploy the `dist/` folder to any static hosting service that supports HTTPS.
